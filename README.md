# PiWeatherClient
![Client Photo](https://github.com/bonnette/genweather/blob/main/piclient.jpg)
<br>
A variation of my PC_weather client except it is written for a Raspberry Pi using C++ and QT
Photo is tha app as rendered by Visual Studio 2019 on a windows system. The app was written on a Raspberry pi.

The app reads a weather string off of an API at openweathermap.org and displays the 
downloaded weather data in a pi window. The large window at the top of the app is the raw data recieved from the website.
I used this app to learn how to recieve and parse JSON data from a website.
